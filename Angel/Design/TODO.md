- [ ] Get back up 
-    [x] remove wstring and platform dependenty conversion 
-    [x] move, build
-    [ ] Fix logic unit tests
-    [ ] Clear distinction between language casts and operators (equal) and C++ operators/bool? Perhaps equal is the same (same type & value) but Cast is not implicit unless infering/matching
-    [ ] Dedesign polymorphic Expression with std::variant 
-    [ ] Refactror Object away 
- [ ] Redesign the parser 
-   [ ] Disjunction and Conjunction are examples of NAry-operators 
-   [ ] Sequences and sets perhaps as well (collections) with the , operator 
- [ ] Prolog 
-   [ ] Parsing enough for axioms
-   [ ] Parsing enough for clauses
-   [ ] query horn clause 
-   [ ] Parsing enough for predicates
-   [ ] Query predicate  
-   [ ] Parse variables 
-   [ ] Variable clauses with substitution 
-   [ ] Query with variable and return hypotheses
- [ ] Functional 
-   [ ] define constants 
-   [ ] define lambdas 
-   [ ] integer math
-   [ ] query lambda
-   [ ] sets 
-   [ ] Membership operator x @ {x,y}
- Python
-   [ ] namespaces
-   [ ] Indexing sequences (not sets)  [x,y,z][1]
-   [ ] ranges [x:y] 
-   [ ] infinite ranges [:y]
-   [ ] range slicing
-   [ ] For each operator *[x,y]
-   [ ] Make knowledge and namespace expressions 
- [ ] Advanced
-   [ ] Add floating points and conversions
-   [ ] For any operator `@` while infering 
-   [ ] For any & each operators also while matching 
-   [ ] Other MFINAE type matching or even some concept like syntax 
- [ ] Native functions
-    [ ] Add native cast functions (int, float, str)
-    [ ] Add native collections functions (size, empty)
-    [ ] Add native collection casts
-    [ ] print / trace 
-    [ ] Import of custom native functions (eg math)
